# Supported Cryptocurrencies

## Overview

Valut supports a variety of cryptocurrencies for making UPI payments. We've carefully selected these currencies based on liquidity, stability, and user demand to provide the best possible payment experience.

| **USDT** | Tether (USDT) is one of the most widely used stablecoins in the world. | Ethereum, Base |

### Major Cryptocurrencies

These are the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization.

| Currency | Description | Network |

- **SOL** - Solana's native cryptocurrency

## How Conversion Works

When you make a payment with Valut:

1. **Exchange Rate Determination**
   - Valut sources real-time exchange rates from multiple providers
   - We use a volume-weighted average to ensure competitive rates

2. **Fee Structure**
   - A fixed 2% fee is applied to all transactions
   - This fee covers conversion costs and network fees
   - No hidden spreads or additional charges

3. **Price Lock**
   - The exchange rate is locked for 30 seconds while you confirm your transaction
   - This protects you from price fluctuations during the payment process

## Network Fees

When depositing or withdrawing cryptocurrency to/from your Valut wallet, standard network fees apply:

- These fees vary by blockchain network and network congestion
- Fees are displayed transparently before you confirm any transaction
- Valut does not charge additional fees on deposits or withdrawals

## Maximum Transaction Limits

For security and operational reasons, we maintain the following transaction limits:

| Currency | Minimum Transaction | Maximum Transaction |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| USDC/USDT | ₹100 | ₹100,000 per transaction |
| BTC | ₹100 | ₹100,000 per transaction |
| ETH | ₹100 | ₹100,000 per transaction |

Higher limits may be available based on your account history and verification level. Please contact support for more information.
