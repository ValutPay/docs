# Introduction

## What is Valut?

Valut is an innovative payment platform that connects your cryptocurrency holdings with India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Our mission is to make cryptocurrencies useful for everyday transactions by allowing you to pay with crypto anywhere UPI is accepted.

## Why Valut?

Cryptocurrencies have tremendous potential, but their real-world utility has been limited. Valut changes that by enabling you to use your digital assets at millions of merchants throughout India, without those merchants needing to make any changes to their payment systems.

## Key Features

### Real-World Utility
Your crypto can now be used for everyday purchases - from groceries to bill payments, anywhere UPI is accepted.

### Seamless Integration
Works with the existing UPI infrastructure that's already widespread throughout India.

### Instant Settlement
No waiting for blockchain confirmations. Payments settle almost instantly, just like standard UPI transactions.

### Transparent Pricing
Simple, transparent 2% fee on each transaction. No hidden costs or exchange rate markups.

### Regulatory Compliance
Built with KYC/AML procedures to ensure full compliance with Indian financial regulations.

## How It Works in Brief

Valut's core functionality can be summarized in three simple steps:

1. **Scan** - Use the Valut app to scan any UPI QR code
2. **Select** - Choose which cryptocurrency you want to pay with
3. **Pay** - Confirm the transaction and complete your payment

Behind the scenes, Valut handles all the complexity:
- Converting your crypto to INR at competitive rates
- Processing the payment through the UPI system
- Ensuring the merchant receives INR just like any other UPI transaction
