# Making Your First Payment

This guide will walk you through the process of making your first payment using Valut. The entire process follows our simple "Scan, Select, Pay" flow.

## Prerequisites

Before making your first payment, ensure you have:

- Completed the [registration and KYC process](../getting-started/registration-kyc.md)
- Set up your Valut wallet
- Deposited cryptocurrency into your wallet
- Enabled necessary permissions for the Valut app (camera access for QR scanning)

## Step 1: Scan Any UPI QR Code

1. **Open the Valut App**
   - Launch the Valut app on your smartphone
   - Log in if necessary

2. **Tap the "Scan" Button**
   - The scan button is prominently displayed on the home screen
   - This will open your phone's camera

3. **Scan the QR Code**
   - Point your camera at any UPI QR code
   - Hold steady until the app recognizes the code
   - The app will automatically detect merchant details and payment information

> **Tip**: Make sure there's adequate lighting and the QR code is fully visible in the camera frame.

## Step 2: Select Your Cryptocurrency

1. **Review Payment Details**
   - The app will display the merchant name and the payment amount in INR
   - Verify these details are correct

2. **Choose Your Crypto**
   - Swipe through available cryptocurrencies in your wallet
   - For each option, you'll see:
     - The equivalent amount in cryptocurrency
     - The exchange rate being used
     - The 2% transaction fee
     - The total amount to be deducted from your wallet

3. **Confirm Selection**
   - Tap on your preferred cryptocurrency to select it
   - Review the final amount once more

> **Note**: The exchange rate is locked for 30 seconds while you review your transaction.

## Step 3: Complete Your Payment

1. **Tap "Pay Now"**
   - Review the final summary that shows:
     - Merchant details
     - Amount in INR
     - Selected cryptocurrency and amount
     - Fee amount
     - Total deduction from your wallet

2. **Authorize the Transaction**
   - Depending on your security settings, you'll need to:
     - Scan your fingerprint
     - Enter your PIN
     - Use Face ID
   - This provides an extra layer of security for your transactions

3. **Wait for Confirmation**
   - The app will display a progress indicator while processing your payment
   - This typically takes just a few seconds

4. **Payment Complete**
   - You'll see a success screen with transaction details
   - The merchant will receive the INR amount via UPI, just like a normal transaction
   - A receipt will be stored in your transaction history

## After Your Payment

- **Transaction Receipt**:
  - A detailed receipt is saved in your transaction history
  - You can access this anytime from the "Transactions" tab
  
- **Merchant Experience**:
  - The merchant receives INR through their standard UPI setup
  - They get a normal UPI notification, completely unaware that you paid with crypto
  
- **Balance Update**:
  - Your crypto balance will be updated instantly in the app

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during your first payment:

### QR Code Not Scanning

- Ensure adequate lighting
- Make sure the entire QR code is visible
- Clean your camera lens if necessary
- Try scanning from a different angle

### Payment Processing Issues

- Check your internet connection
- Verify you have sufficient balance in your selected cryptocurrency
- Ensure the merchant's UPI ID is valid and active
